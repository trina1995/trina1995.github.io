<p><strong>Objective</strong><br />
I want to explore new dimensions of the world of statistical inference and data science. Through the ages, especially in the regime of Statistical data analysis, the inferential methods have played a revolutionary role. On that note, my interest lies in the field of statistical inference, data mining and machine learning. My aim is to work on this field in a more rigorous way so that my contribution enriches the subject as well as its application in real-life cases. Apart from that, playing with various visualization techniques is another point of interest of mine.<br />

<strong>Title: A study on classical inference on single binomial proportion</strong><br />
<strong>Duration:</strong>October, 2017- May, 2018<br />
<strong>Supervisor:</strong> DR. Subbiah M. ( Former Associate Professor, Presidency College, Chennai, India)<br />
<strong>Short description:</strong><br />
We revisited the problem of interval estimation of a binomial distribution.The focus has been fixed on the justification of choice of several confidence intervals based on their respective coverage probabilities. The performances of the confidence intervals have been analyzed with help of coverage probabilities and expected run length. Further, proposition of new interval has been placed and it has been compared with the help of coverage probability and expected run length.<br />

<strong>Title: Comparative Analysis of Two <span class="math inline">1 × <em>j</em></span> contingency table under Bayesian perspective</strong><br />
<strong>Authors</strong>: Deboddep Banerjee, Trina Sahoo, DR. Subbiah M. and DR. M.R. Srinivasan<br />
<strong>Duration:</strong>March, 2017- February, 2018<br />
<strong>Publication:</strong> University department library, Department of Statistics, University of Madras, February, 2018<br />
<strong>Short description:</strong><br />
This study has exploited these aspects into categorical data of two one-dimensional variables each with same J levels of categories. The notion focussing on the ratio of independent Beta distribution is considered using closed form approach with Gauss hypergeometric function and Monte-Carlo techniques. The entire approach is illustrated with a primary data set that aims to study the impact of gender on perceived important social issues; essential computations are carried out using R program. The modelling advantages of Bayesian approach has been studied and the results are directly interpreted regarding the context of the problem.<br />

<h1 id="websraping-lda-and-forecasting"><a href="https://github.com/Debodeep94/Webscraping-and-LDA">Websraping, LDA and forecasting</a></h1>
<p>In this project I scraped the data from a website where all the speeches of several central banks’ board members are stored in textual formats. I scrapped their speeches based on USA and China. Some concepts of NLP was used for preliminary data analysis. Then I implemented Latent Dirichlet Analysis and finally I addressed a forecasting problem with LSTM and LSTM autoencoder.</p>
<h1 id="stock-market-prediction-using-twitter-data"><a href="https://github.com/Debodeep94/Stock-market-prediction-using-twitter-data">Stock market prediction using twitter data</a></h1>
<p>In this project, I encounter a stock market prediction problem with the data of 2015 to 2021 of ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation). In this project we have implemented LSTM model in order to predict the future data. Further, specifically in the stock data, the volatility of stock data highly depends on news and/ or social media. Combining the scores obtained from the sentiment analysis of the tweets and the stock data, another LSTM model has been developed.</p>
<h1 id="model-interpretability-using-lime"><a href="https://github.com/Debodeep94/Model-interpretability-using-LIME">Model interpretability using LIME</a></h1>
<p>In this project I considered a classification task using CNN and implemented LIME to address the concept of model interpretability. I used a dataset of archaeological buildings with 10 classes.</p>
<h1 id="fire-detection-using-convolutional-neural-network"><a href="https://github.com/Debodeep94/Fire-Detection-using-convilutional-neural-network">Fire Detection using convolutional neural network</a></h1>
<p>We collected the data from Kaggle and CVPR lab. The aim was to classify between images with fire and images without fire. For this task we compared between three models, viz. CNN, Bayesian CNN and Resnet50.</p>

<p>We did a Literature review of the paper obtained from Scopus and WOS. Then we introduced an application of PRISMA model and Ontological Modelling using <em>Eddy</em> and <em>Protege</em>. We made the visualization using Biblioshiny, VOSviewer.And finally we applied Probability Graphical Model and Efficiency Analysis.<br />
</p>
<h1 id="linear-regression-using-jags"><a href="https://rpubs.com/Debodeep1994/happy_bayes">Linear regression using JAGS</a></h1>
<p>In this project we compared the performance of two statistical models. The first one is multiple linear regression model and the second one is bayesian model using JAGS.</p>
<h1 id="covid-situation-visualization"><a href="https://github.com/Debodeep94/Covid-and-choropleth/blob/main/Covid_19_India_update_Personal.ipynb">Covid situation visualization</a></h1>
<p>It is a self interested project. I tried to create some visualization(both static and animated) which depict the contemporary situation of India in the covid situation.<br />
